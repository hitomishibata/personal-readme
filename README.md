## Introduction
Hello all! I'm Hitomi. I'm from Osaka in Japan. I came to the Netherlands for the first time as an exchange student in 2019. Then I moved here in 2021 for study and work as I was impressed by how people exchange their opinions regardless of their age, gender, positions etc and how people care the environment.
Fun Fact About Me: I just switched my career from Pedagogical Science to IT last October based on my huge passion toward data. In my previous job, I worked as a coordinator of a research community at a university in the Netherlands. Then, I completed an IT traineeship, especially focusing on data engineering and analytics this month. Now, I'm looking for a new challenge in which I can make use of my data and soft skills!

## Personal Development
### What I value
I value different talents people have and passion to contribute to the society in different ways. I worked at various environments and met with many people from diverse backgrounds. I enjoyed getting to know them more and more everyday, discovering their strengthes and goals. Some talents are more noticible but others are hidden. I believe we enhance the quality of work if we are more open to discover different strengths and make use of them and encourage goal-oriented approach for everyday work.
